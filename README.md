# Inconsistent Tailwind CSS Class Application

This repository demonstrates a bug where Tailwind CSS classes are not applied consistently across different elements, despite correct configuration and imports.  The issue appears to be related to the combination of classes used or the nesting of elements. 

## Bug Description:

Certain Tailwind CSS classes fail to render on some elements, while others work as expected.  This behavior is inconsistent and difficult to predict. Standard troubleshooting steps (checking imports, configuration, and CSS order) have not resolved the problem.

## Steps to Reproduce:

1. Clone the repository.
2. Open `bug.html` in a browser.
3. Observe the inconsistent application of Tailwind CSS classes.

## Solution:

The solution involves carefully reviewing the HTML structure and class combinations.  In some cases, incorrect class ordering or unexpected CSS specificity could cause the issue.  The `solution.html` file provides a corrected version where the problem is resolved by restructuring the HTML.
